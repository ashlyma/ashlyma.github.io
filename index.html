        <p> My name is Ashly Martinez Rodriguez and I am from Dominican Republic. You can click the <br>
             "About me" button to learn more about me. This website is going to be a portafalio for <br>
             incoming JavaScript projects in CSC106. I have taken web development and coding classes in <br>
             the past so the material in class is familiar to me. I still believe that my technical skills <br>
            could be still use some work. I am very excited to create my own games in the future! <br></p>
